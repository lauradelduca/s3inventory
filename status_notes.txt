prioritizing clean-up of 
Argentina
Brazil

with 
Ecuador
Peru
Costa Rica
Uruguay


--- PARAGUAY ---

has commas in string weight, so remove that, convert, sum: still far from good

--- COSTA RICA ---

looks great, except for one/two values in 2016 and 2017
(2016, 2017 are seemingly mostly in numbers/separators problems table, although numbers look perfect!
open in R and check type etc
don't focus on this)

2016 shrimps (0.77 ratio):
three units: caja, carton, bultos, but all have net weight
all are caja, except for one carton and one bultos
the bultos one stands out with a very small weight
bultos means bulge, undetermined volume
bultos is also the only shipment by air, not sea, so maybe weight is valid
both 2016 shrimps and the comtrade16 records are only one hs code, and just don't sum up

2016 sugar cane (0.89 ratio):
multiple units, types of transport, but all have net kg
> unique(data_sugarcane$MEASURE_UNIT_1_QUANTITY_1)
[1] CAJA           BULTOS         BOLSA          ROLLO          GRANEL         GRANEL LIQUIDO SACO 
weights are varying a lot, all separators seem good
two records with weight == 0, value == 0 but number of items 1 and 4

not looking further into 2017 for now as comtrade is for 2016


--- ECUADOR --- 

(2013 same re problem table as costa rica)
seems ok except for two commodities: palm oil too high, and wood pulp precise one year and 0 both Trase and Comtrade others
need to look into both 


--- PERU ---

needs correct column, not picked up
but it should be correct, otherwise error message,
so maybe type character and solved?


--- URUGUAY ---

some files don't have correct column names
see comtrade_check.R part where variables are selected for each country/file for notes
2012 is not available to download anymore
redownload 2012 not ready, just cut it
