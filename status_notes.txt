has commas in string weight, so remove that, convert, sum: still far from good

--- COSTA RICA ---

looks great, except for one/two values in 2016 and 2017
(2016, 2017 are seemingly mostly in numbers/separators problems table, although numbers look perfect!
open in R and check type etc
don't focus on this)

2016 shrimps (0.77 ratio):
three units: caja, carton, bultos, but all have net weight
all are caja, except for one carton and one bultos
the bultos one stands out with a very small weight
bultos means bulge, undetermined volume
bultos is also the only shipment by air, not sea, so maybe weight is valid
both 2016 shrimps and the comtrade16 records are only one hs code, and just don't sum up

2016 sugar cane (0.89 ratio):
multiple units, types of transport, but all have net kg
> unique(data_sugarcane$MEASURE_UNIT_1_QUANTITY_1)
[1] CAJA           BULTOS         BOLSA          ROLLO          GRANEL         GRANEL LIQUIDO SACO 
weights are varying a lot, all separators seem good
two records with weight == 0, value == 0 but number of items 1 and 4

not looking further into 2017 for now as comtrade is for 2016


--- ECUADOR --- 

(2013 same re problem table as costa rica)
seems ok except for two commodities: palm oil too high, and wood pulp precise one year and 0 both Trase and Comtrade others
need to look into both 


--- PERU ---

years 2016-2017 great
years 2013-2015 redownloaded reduced number of columns, only what's needed to upload

removed comma in weight_column

flags:

2012 no leather, timber
2013 chicken 1.22 ratio, palm oil 1.17 ratio
2014 chicken 0.73
2016 palm oil 1.12


--- URUGUAY ---

some files had incorrect column names so re-downloaded 2013-2017
we drop 2012 as too problematic and not available for download

after replacing ',' with '' in weight_column (removing thousands separator ,):
results for 2013-2017 are great

flags:
wood pulp 0.81 for 2013
soy beans 1.12 for 2014
soy beans 1.24 for 2016
2017 a bit more variance as comtrade data is for 2016, but looks good enough
